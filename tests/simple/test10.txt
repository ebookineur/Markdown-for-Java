<h3 id="autolink">Automatic Links</h3>

Markdown supports a shortcut style for creating "automatic" links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets. What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address, and also have it be a clickable link, you can do this:

    <http://example.com/>

Markdown will turn this into:

    <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>
